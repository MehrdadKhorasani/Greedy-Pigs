Bugs:
  NPC mode:
    Npc turn:
      1. If the last roll was a double, npc rolls again. but if the new roll was a double again, the game stops.
      2. If hit "N" or "ESC" in the npc's turn, rolls keep going.
      3. If the last roll was the third double in this turn, first switchplayer() called and then one roll for the opponent will done.
  All situation:
    1. When game ends, "N" and "ESC" won't work. because these work when playing being true.
    2. implement the game for smartphone.
    3. 101 < score situation.
    4. check all the situation and make the status bar complete.
    5. Is there a way to implement all the game in OOP?
